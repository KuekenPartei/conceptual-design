The basic pricipals of politics for the KUEKeN party.

The main and simple idea of the KUEKeN party is the statement that politic need to be concentrated on the future. The future has already arrived in form of our children. So when we want to make politic for the future, and this is the only politics possible because every thing else is administration, we need to make politics for our children. 

Politics for children is always politic for humans, because we humans are responsible for our children, and a politic for children need to support us humans in this responsibility.

Children are always also children of the society. (To grab this idea read Samuel Scheffler "Death and the Afterlife" or watch/read "the children of men". P. D. James) 

From this simple and basic idea of caring we deviate the main party principals

1. pacifism
2. secularism
3. focus on the present
4. structurally unfinished
5. conservation of nature
6. solidarity
7. equity
8. lifetime as treasure
9. cooperation instead of competition 
10. commitment to the universal human rights


The KUEKeN party is devoted to enlightenment in the matter of Kant:

>Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed nonage. Nonage is the inability to use one's own understanding without another's guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one's own mind without another's guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) "Have the courage to use your own understanding," is therefore the motto of the enlightenment. 


"Without children there will be no future, without future there is no history, without history there is no meaning"
